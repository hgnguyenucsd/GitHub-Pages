## About Me

Hello there, my name is **Henry Nguyen** and I'm currently a 4th year majoring in **Computer Science** at the **University of California, San Diego** transferring from **De Anza Community College**. Since _Java_ is what I started off with, I definitely have a bias towards using it, but I've also grown to love the simplicity of _Python_ as well. Throughout my academic journey, I've gained the skills necessary to pick up on other languages quickly as well if I would ever needed to use them for any projects or work. I would like to describe myself as really down-to-earth and really easy to approach, so don't be afraid to come up and talk to me. When working in teams or groups, I will give everyone equal amounts of respect and be supportive to all the people that I'm surrounded by.

## Goals for Myself

- [ ] Graduate with a B.S. Degree
- [ ] Get into a Master's Program
- [ ] Apply for a summer internship throughout the quarter
- [ ] Make smart investments
- [ ] Get rid of bad habits, in with the good
- [ ] Learn to cook

I try to model my mindset after one of the greatest basketball players to play the game, Michael Jordan:

> I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.

> I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
