## About Me

Hello there, my name is **Henry Nguyen** and I'm currently a 4th year majoring in **Computer Science** at the **University of California, San Diego** transferring from **De Anza Community College**. Since _Java_ is what I started off with, I definitely have a bias towards using it, but I've also grown to love the simplicity of _Python_ as well. Throughout my academic journey, I've gained the skills necessary to pick up on other languages quickly as well if I would ever needed to use them for any projects or work. I would like to describe myself as really down-to-earth and really easy to approach, so don't be afraid to come up and talk to me. When working in teams or groups, I will give everyone equal amounts of respect and be supportive to all the people that I'm surrounded by.

## Hobbies

On my free time there are a couple of things that I really enjoy doing to take my mind off things. They include:

- Basketball & Running
- Hanging out with family & friends
- Watching Anime
- Trying out new food
- Gaming & Watching Streams
- Travel lots in the future
- Watching videos about tech

My favorite basketball team is the Toronto Raptors. I would also love to visit Japan the most in the future.

## Goals for Myself

1. [ ] Graduate with a B.S. Degree
2. [ ] Get into a Master's Program
3. [ ] Apply for a summer internship throughout the quarter
4. [ ] Make smart investments
5. [ ] Get rid of bad habits, in with the good
6. [ ] Learn to cook
7. [ ] Land my first full-time job and start my career

I try to model my mindset after one of the greatest basketball players to play the game, Michael Jordan:

> I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.
> I've failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.
